# Vue 3 + Vite & defineAsyncComponent

This is a simple project that explores dynamically using vue components. 

I am using it to understand why Vite, when run in `dev` mode works fine but NOT in `build`

There are two branches Master and solution. The solution is to declare the dynamic Vue components
